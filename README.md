# direct ads

This dapp allows publishers and advertisers to transact directly, without a
middleman (e.g. Google AdSense).

* Publishers add their unique inventory (e.g. a pre-roll ad space in a video)
  by minting an NFT.
* Advertisers make bids on the inventory they are interested in.
* Publishers accept offers, display ads, and get paid directly by advertisers.
* The whole process is managed by a few smart contracts on the Ethereum
  blockchain.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
